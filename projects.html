                <h3>BCI Mouse Automation</h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> I developed software to automate mouse control for individuals paralyzed from the neck down, using an 8-32 electrode BCI headset, BCI board, SSVEP screen, and Python. My responsibilities included designing a robust BCI system for accurate signal acquisition, implementing advanced signal processing methods to enhance control capabilities, and writing Python scripts for seamless communication between the BCI system and mouse interface. I also created an intuitive user interface for easy navigation and ensured effective hardware integration with the SSVEP screen for timely visual stimuli. This project culminated in the publication of a research paper titled "Brain-Computer Interface for Mouse Automation" in the International Journal of Engineering Technology Research & Management, highlighting our contributions to the field.</p>

                <h3> The Urban-Thrift E-commerce Website</h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> I developed a comprehensive website for buying and selling both new and used items within the college community, utilizing HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Flask, and SQL. This full-stack development project involved building the site from the ground up, encompassing front-end design and coding, back-end functionality, and data storage solutions. We conducted thorough testing and optimization to ensure a seamless user experience, followed by the deployment and ongoing maintenance of the website to guarantee its reliability. As a key achievement, I submitted the project to the College Thrifting Club and delivered a highly rated, user-friendly platform that met the needs of our community.</p>

                <h3>Hospital Management System</h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> I developed a Hospital Management System using MySQL, HTML, and CSS, designed to enhance patient experience and streamline operations. The system allows patients to check doctors' qualifications, helping them make informed decisions when selecting a healthcare provider. Additionally, doctors can access and manage comprehensive records of their patients, ensuring that all relevant information is readily available for effective care. This system improves communication and efficiency within the hospital, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.</p>

                <h3>Face-Emotion Detection Filter</h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> I created a face-emotion detection filter using Spark AI to monitor students' engagement during online classes, specifically to identify when students may be falling asleep. This innovative solution leverages advanced facial recognition technology to analyze students' expressions in real-time, providing educators with valuable insights into classroom dynamics. By detecting signs of drowsiness or disengagement, the filter aims to enhance learning experiences and encourage active participation, ultimately fostering a more interactive and effective online learning environment.</p>
